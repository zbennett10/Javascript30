    // Let's say we have an array ARRAYS AND OBJECTS ARE REFERENCE TYPES*********
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;


    // You might think we can just do something like this: 
    team[3] = 'Lux'; //changes player array as well

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    //ways to create deep copies
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    const team4 = [...players]; //takes every item out of iterable and puts it into new array
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: "Zach Bennett",
      age: 80
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; //changes both

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99});
    //creates a 1 level deep copy of object and allows you to make changes inline

    //shows that this only works one level deep. its a shallow copy beyond first object level
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@webos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

      const dev = Object.assign({}, wes); //only works one level deep
    
    //changes to the social object make changes to the original object
     //if you want to clone deep you need to find a clone deep function
     //this is very rare

     //poor man's deep clone
     const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
     //turns object to string and then immediately parses it back into an object
